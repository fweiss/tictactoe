The rules of the tic tac toe game are the following:

a winner when all fields in a column are taken by a player
a winner when all fields in a row are taken by a player
a winner when all fields in a diagonal are taken by a player
a draw when all fields are taken

a player can take a field if not already taken
players take turns taking fields until the game is over
